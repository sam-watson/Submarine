Submarine Mobile App

*This app was built with a dependency on a proprietary Unity3D library called NGUI which has been removed from the repository and history for public display. This source code is intended here as a portfolio sample only and will not function as provided. 

This is an experimental game application built in Unity3D to prototype and explore use of mobile device gyroscope and the respective Unity3D api as part of a user input/control scheme. At the time, the api proved to be too poorly documented, standardized, and difficult to test for the project to move beyond a prototype.
